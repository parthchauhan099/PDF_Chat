# PDF Chat

This project allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions about their content. The system uses a Large Language Model (LLM) powered by Google Gemini, the Langchain framework, and ChromaDB for efficient information retrieval. A user-friendly interface is built with Streamlit.

## Overview

PDF Chat provides a seamless way to interact with PDF documents. Instead of manually searching through pages, users can ask specific questions and receive concise, relevant answers generated by the LLM. This makes it ideal for tasks like:

*   Summarizing lengthy reports
*   Finding specific information within research papers
*   Extracting key data from contracts
*   Quickly understanding complex documents

## Technologies Used

*   **LLM:** Google Gemini - Provides the powerful language understanding and generation capabilities.
*   **Langchain:** A framework that simplifies the development of applications powered by language models. It's used for prompt engineering, document loading, and interaction with the LLM.
*   **ChromaDB:** A vector database used for storing and efficiently querying document embeddings. This enables fast and accurate retrieval of relevant information based on user questions.
*   **Streamlit:** A Python library for building interactive web applications. Used to create the user-friendly frontend interface.

## Features

*   **PDF Upload:** Users can upload PDF files directly through the web interface.
*   **Question Answering:** Users can ask questions in natural language related to the uploaded PDF.
*   **Contextual Answers:** The system provides answers based on the content of the PDF document.
